The Forward Problem
===================

Many types of wave motion can be described mathematically by the equation :math:`u_{tt} = \nabla \cdot (c^2\nabla u)+f`. We use a more compact notation for the partial derivatives to save space:

.. math::

	u_t = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}, \quad u_{tt} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} 

Let's implement a solver for the 1D scalar acoustic wave equation with absorbing boundary conditions. Let :math:`u(x,t)` be the displacement at time t and at space location x, which is the wavefield. The displacement function :math:`u` is governed by the following mathematical model.

.. :label: euler

.. math::


	\begin{split}
	\frac{1}{c(x)^2} u_{tt}(x,t) - u_{xx}(x,t) & = f(x,t), \\ 
	\frac{1}{c(0)}u_t(0,t)-u_x(0,t) & = 0, \\ 
	\frac{1}{c(1)}u_t(1,t)+u_x(1,t) & = 0, \\ 
	u(x,t) & = 0 \quad\text{for}\quad t \le 0,
	\end{split}


where the middle two equations are the absorbing boundary conditions, the last equation gives initial conditions, :math:`x \in [0,1]`, and :math:`t \in [0,T]`. The model velocity is given by the function :math:`c(x)`.

In our notation, we write that solving this PDE is equivalent to applying a nonlinear operator :math:`\mathcal{F}` to a model parameter :math:`m`, where :math:`m(x) = \frac{1}{c(x)^2}` for the scalar acoustics problem.

We then write that :math:`\mathcal{F}[m] = u`.

Seismic Sources
---------------

:math:`f(x,t)` is the force function or source function in the above equation. We need to define it first.

We define our source functions as :math:`f(x,t) = w(t)\delta(x-x_s)`, where :math:`w(t)` is the time profile, :math:`\delta` indicates that we will use point sources, and the source location is :math:`x_0`.
In real world applications, the time profile is not known and is estimated as part of the inverse problem. However, it is common to model source signals with the negative second derivative of a Gaussian, also known as the Ricker Wavelet:

.. math::

  w(t) = (1-2\pi^2\nu_0^2t^2)e^{-\pi^2\nu_0^2t^2}

where :math:`nu_0` is known as the characteristic or peak frequency (in Hz), because the magitude of :math:`w`â€˜s Fourier transform :math:`|\hat w|` attains its maximum at that frequency.
It is also important that this function is causal (:math:`w(t) = 0` for :math:`t\le 0`), so we introduce a time shift :math:`t_0`,

.. math::

 w(t) = (1-2\pi^2\nu_0^2(t-t_0)^2)e^{-\pi^2\nu_0^2(t-t_0)^2}.


.. topic:: Problem 1.1

    Write a Python function ``ricker(t, config)`` which implements the Ricker
    Wavelet, taking a time ``t`` in seconds and your configuration dictionary.
    This function should assume that your configuration dictionary has a key
    ``nu0`` representing the peak frequency, in Hz.  Your function should
    returns the value of the wavelet at time ``t``.

    You can guarantee causality by setting :math:`t_0= 6\sigma` for
    :math:`\sigma = \tfrac{1}{\pi\nu_0\sqrt{2}}`, the standard deviation of
    the underlying Gaussian. You may also want to implement an optional
    threshold to prevent excessively small numbers.

    Plot your function for :math:`t = 0, \dots, T=0.5` at :math:`\nu_0 =
    10\textrm{Hz}` and label the plot.
